- REREAD THIS: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20083032/coremotion-updates-in-background-state
- ISSUE: not getting activity tracking data, which is starving the run loop and causing our background task to expire.
- NOTES FROM READING LOG ON DESKTOP:
  - Geofence exit took ~10 minutes to fire. (around belmont st on the way home)
  - every GPS update is scheduling a background task
    - background tasks are expiring (after around 4 mins)
  - it split the thing into two trips for some reason
    - that's because it crashed due to the background task expiring. huh.
  - the new route was started when i opened my phone in the oaks bottom parking lot
    - however, it first dumped some stale locations from back on division street (locations 1-3)


- look at startMonitoringVisits, use to end/begin trips instead of the geofence?
  - or to collect more precise starting-at/designation information
- 


//  INITIAL STATE: Wake up due to background app refresh and/or geofence exit
//
//  - check speed. are we moving?
//      - NO
//          - Are stationary?
//              - YES: set a geofence, go to sleep, back to begining
//      - YES
//          - how long have we been moving? add time stamp to map. guess starting location my extrapolating in a straight line based on distance, speed and heading
//  - turn on location tracking, motion tracking
//      - get a location update
//      - add location to current route
//  - get a motion update
//      - are we still moving?
//      - NO: end route, go to sleep, back to begining
