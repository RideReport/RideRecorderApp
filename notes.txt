- look at startMonitoringVisits, use to end/begin trips instead of the geofence?
  - or to collect more precise starting-at/designation information
- 


//  INITIAL STATE: Wake up due to background app refresh and/or geofence exit
//
//  - check motion activity. are we cycling?
//      - NO
//          - Are stationary?
//              - YES: set a geofence, go to sleep, back to begining
//      - NO
//          - how long have we been moving? add time stamp to map. guess starting location my extrapolating in a straight line based on distance, speed and heading
//  - turn on location tracking, motion tracking
//      - get a location update
//      - add location to current route
//  - get a motion update
//      - are we still moving?
//      - NO: end route, go to sleep, back to begining
